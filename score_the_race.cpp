// Shimon Savitsky Score the Race
/******
  We'll set up and initialize an array for the scores, and an array for the amount of runners on each team.
  Create an outer loop to that will keep looping if the amount of runners per team is unequal.
  Inside, make another loop that will keep asking for a string until the user inputs done.
  Make another loop that records all the information based on the outcome provvided by the user.
  And the last loop should test whether or not the user entered an invalid outcome with an uneven
  amount of runners.  If the user entered a valid outcome then the loop should break.
  At the end print out oll the results and the winner.
